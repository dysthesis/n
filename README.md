# zk - a command-line Zettelkasten bookkeeping utility

This project is a command-line utility for managing Zettelkasten-style notes. It is intended primarily for personal use

## Roadmap

- [x] Getting links and backlinks to and from a note
- [x] Performing queries on frontmatter attributes
- [x] Perform full-text search
  - **Note:** The lexing of notes probably still needs to be improved.
- [x] Calculate the "importance" of a note based on Katz centrality or PageRank
- [ ] Creating templates for notes
- [ ] Providing an LSP
- [ ] Updating links upon renaming a note

## Prior art

- [zk-org/zk](https://github.com/zk-org/zk) - a plaintext note-taking assistant, written in Go.
- [sirupsen/zk](https://github.com/sirupsen/zk) - a collection of scripts, both in shell and Ruby, for managing a Zettelkasten.
